	Checking email addresses for validity is a tricky process. EmailValidator.Net has made this process incredibly simple and powerful.
The only correct way to verify an email address exists is to send a mailbox an email and see if you receive a bounce back email or NDR (Non-Deliverable Receipt).
	Or you can use socket to ping the dns server before you send the emai to user.
